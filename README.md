# Situation:
Students will use this application to manage a list of courses they will be attending (or plan to attend) during a certain term.

# Tasks:
The application will start with 4 basic courses that belong to the Core part for the AS Degree in CNIT:
<ul>
  <li>CNIT 103 - Hardware – 3 units</li>
  <li>CNIT 131 – Internet & Intro to HTML, CSS – 3 units</li>
  <li>CNIT 106 – Introduction to Networks – 3 units</li>
  <li>CNIT 120 – Network Security – 3 units</li>
</ul>
Application behaviors/features:
<ul>
  <li>Show the initial list of courses (list shown above).</li>
  <li>The student (user) will be able to add courses, delete courses but the student will NOT be able to edit the course once it has been added. A drop-box is provided, instead of input box, so the student does not need to "memorize" the name of the course, the description of the course, and number of units when trying to add a course to the list of courses he/she plans to attend.</li>
  <li>The possibility of modifying the theme (dark theme, light theme)of the page of courses being presented.</li>
</ul>
The application is deployed in a web server. I deployed to Surge. The URL of my application became invalid in a few weeks due to time limit.

# Feedback:
From Claudia Ferreira Da Silva: "Nicely done but here a food for thought - semantically the switch button is above the header of the app - suggestion would be to put at the bottom or at least after the header! But the theme is changing."
